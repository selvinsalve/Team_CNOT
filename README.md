Blockchain utilises a shared distributed ledger, which is essentially a data structure with an ordered list of transactions, to work around the problem of decentralising the system. A lot of work has been carried out in the field of privacy and blockchain. In the next five years, blockchain technology, which is still in its early days, has enormous potential. In addition to these developments, a few blockchain-related problems still need to be resolved over time. Information leakage in real-world applications and privacy concerns are two of blockchain's main problems.
Differential privacy protects private information by introducing a certain amount of noise to protect individual privacy. Distinctive privacy  ensures that the existence or nonexistence of any particular participant  does not modify a dataset's query output results. This concept can be applied for real-time health data monitoring, energy systems, IOT data, etc. It can be used to prevent information leaks and safeguard blockchain privacy.
