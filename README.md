Blockchain utilises a shared distributed ledger, which is essentially a data structure with an ordered list of transactions, to work around the problem of decentralising the system.
Differential privacy protects private information by introducing a certain amount of noise (calculated afterward) to protect individual privacy. Distinctive privacy  ensures that the existence or nonexistence of any particular participant  does not modify a dataset's query output results.
